## kaboom

This repository collects folk wisdom from the R modeling community about how to reliably work with *existing model packages*.

The goal is to document common gotchas and workarounds so that you don't have to rediscover and solve them on your own.

If you are *implementing a new model*, please take a look at the `tidymodels` [model implementation principles](https://github.com/tidymodels/model-implementation-principles).

This is a skeleton project at the moment, to be filled in with additional details.

Please share your knowledge in the issues, or by opening a PR!
